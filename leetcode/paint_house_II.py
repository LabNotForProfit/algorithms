Problem:
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a
certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is
the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find
the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.
Follow up:
Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
